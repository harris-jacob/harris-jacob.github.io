Hello, my name is Jacob and i'm a student of software. Lots of people have told me that writing a blog is a great way of organizing thoughts and challenging your own opinions. Since my thoughts and opinions often come across as mad ramblings, I am giving blogging a chance to improve my communication skills.

## What to expect

As for the flavour of posts, I hope to provide a mixture of informative like tutorials, war stories and useful snippets, but I also want to voice some spicy takes.
As for the particular topics, expect a mix of a few disciplines and lots of technologies. I am one of those devs who lies to himself and others by calling myself a "fullstack" developer. That being said, I am particularly fond of web-dev, which I guess today is pretty broad.

Full disclaimer I am a software developer not a writer, my prose and grammar are not indicative of my code, so please don't judge my writing (but absolutely judge my code).
This blog is a learning experience. I hope to provide, if not knowledge, then at least some entertainment and I would be more than happy to hear any feedback or questions. You can reach me by [email](mailto:jacob.harris443@gmail.com).

```C
int main() {
   printf("Hello World!");
   return 0;
}
```
